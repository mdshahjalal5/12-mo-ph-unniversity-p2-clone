## keyboard remapping by keyd application

```
n = enter
. = n
capslock = esc,
enter = .
; = f3
f3 = ;
a hold f = ctrl+ f,
; hold f = ctrl + f,
s hold f = super + f,
f hold f = alt + f,
l hold f = shift + f ( that menas capital f),

```

## Arrow key

```
capslock + h = left arrow,
caps + l = right arrow,
caps + j = down arrow,
caps + k = up arrow,

```

# Hyprland tutorial:

## Shutdown, Suspend, Restart

```
s+t = Shutdown the pc
s+r = restart the pc,
s+y = suspend or sleep the pc,
s+q = quit from Hyprland
```

## cursor focus

```
s+h = focus left,
s+l = focus right,
s+j = focus down,
s+k = focus up,
s+f = maximize/minimize

```

## volume control

```
s+f+u = increasing volume,
s+f+i = decrease volume,
```

## swapping windows

```
s+f+h = swap with left,
s+f+l = swap with right,
s+f+j = swap with down,
s+f+k = swap with up,
```

## workspace tutorial

```
s+1/s+u = go workspace 1,
s+2/s+i = go workspace 2,
s+3 = go workspace 3,
s+4 = go workspace 4,
s+5 = go workspace 5, (in this way you can use upto 9 workspace)
```

## Resizing windows

```
s+a+h = resize  left,
s+a+l = resize  right,
s+a+j = resize  down,
s+a+k = resize  up,

```

## Moving windows

```
s+shift+h = move  left,
s+shift+l = move  right,
s+shift+j = move  down,
s+shift+k = move  up,

# Tmux = terminal multiplexer tutorial

```
** seop = session, window, pane,
1. sesssion can hold multiple windows, each window can hold multiple panes,

```

## Tmux Sessions and windows tutorial

( in our pc prefix is f3 and f3 is remapped with semicolon ; \*\* that means you have to press ; )

### see all the keybindings( keyboard shortcuts ) = prefix ?

```
1. see  the existing sessions: prefix  press s
** prefix i = switch(go ) to the last used session
** prefix b = switch to the cfg session
2. create a new session, type  "sess sessionName"
```

### window tutorial

```
3. prefix c = create a new window,
4. prefix 0/1/2/3/4/5 = switch(go) to the 0/1/2/3/4/5th window
5. prefix f = switch to the last used window,
6. prefix p = switch to previous window
7. prefix n = switch to next window
8. prefix , = rename the current  window
9. prefix , = rename the current  window




```

## Tmux pane tutorial

```
1. prefix a = create a new vertical pane( create a new pane below the current pane )
2. prefix v = create a new horizontal  pane( create a new pane right side of  the current pane )
3. ctrl + h, j, k, l = change cursor focus left, down, up, right,
4. prefix x = kill the current pane

```

## Tmux resizing panes

```

1. increase or decrease size
prefix hjkl = resize right, down, up, right (you have to fast type hjkl )
```
