## keyboard remapping by keyd application

```
n = enter
. = n
capslock = esc,
enter = .
; = f3
f3 = ;
a hold f = ctrl+ f,
; hold f = ctrl + f,
s hold f = super + f,
f hold f = alt + f,
l hold f = shift + f ( that menas capital f),

```

## Arrow key

```
capslock + h = left arrow,
caps + l = right arrow,
caps + j = down arrow,
caps + k = up arrow,

```

## Hyprland tutorial:

```
s+h = focus left,
s+l = focus right,
s+j = focus down,
s+k = focus up,
s+f = maximize/minimize

```

## volume control

```
s+f+u = increasing volume,
s+f+i = decrease volume,
```

## swapping windows

```
s+f+h = swap with left,
s+f+l = swap with right,
s+f+j = swap with down,
s+f+k = swap with up,
```

## workspace tutorial

```
s+1/s+u = go workspace 1,
s+2/s+i = go workspace 2,
s+3 = go workspace 3,
s+4 = go workspace 4,
s+5 = go workspace 5, (in this way you can use upto 9 workspace)
```

## moving windows

```
s+shift+h = move  left,
s+shift+l = move  right,
s+shift+j = move  down,
s+shift+k = move  up,
```
